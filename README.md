# Bootcamp overview

In this document, I wanted to explain how this bootcamp is going to be structured.

## Self-paced

The first thing I should mention is that this will be mostly a self-paced program.

As I said on my GitHub sponsors page, I'll try to supply more content as I go.

This will be done in a way that it'll always be evergreen and can be read or watched at any point.

## Content, community, support

With that in mind, I'd like to focus on these three aspects in this program.

1. Content

I'll keep adding more and more content here over time.

2. Community

We'll have a supportive community of developers here. We now have a few private text channels and one voice channel for that.

3. Support

If you have any questions about anything, please let me know. This will help me determine the right content direction going foward.

### If you have access to the voice channel

On a weekday, I'll be online at least once a day, pinging @everyone on the voice channel. In addition, I'll try to be online one more time a day.

The first time is usually around 9am Pacific Time. The second time is usually around 4 or 4:30pm.

If you'd like to know a time in advance, please book a time in my calendar. If you don't find a good time slot, please let me know.
